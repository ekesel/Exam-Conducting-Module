# Exam-Conducting-Module
 Created a program using C++ to conduct exams by using file handling concepts. By this, a person can easily generate random sets of questions for the students and also update their scores for further reference. This also has a login system for each student data. It can generate random questions from three types of file descriptive questions, mcq questions or analytical questions. the generated test will be in doc file and ready to be printed. 
The main program is in Testing platform.cpp
the question pool is in given files - 
1. Questiondesc file which contains descriptive questions line by line.
2. Questionanalytical which contains analytical questions line by line
3. Questionmcq which contains mcq questions each two lines.
There also a counter file which shows how inside programs how many times the program has been used.
There's login data in userdata file and score's data in scoreusers file.
